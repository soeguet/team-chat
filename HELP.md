# Team Chat - Local Network

### This chat program is solely for chat purposes within a local network via the browser

Since Microsoft Teams becomes a paid service and Spring Websockets is working very well with this kind of service I thought to myself: "why not make your own chat".

This chat will cover the very basics of a normal chat for the time being. I might add functions as we go.

Feel free to reach out if you have any kind of suggestions.
